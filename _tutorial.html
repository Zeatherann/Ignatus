<h1>Tutorial</h1>
<p>Let's face it, you'd probably rather be having sex than reading this tutorial. So we'll try to make this as fun, short, and informative as possible so you can build the game, make the money, impress the girl because you can have fun and make ridiculous sums of cash and at the same time to feed her shoe fetish, chocolate lust, and take her luxurious vaccations to your beach house in the Carribean. A beach house, in which, finally, after all your hard work, you get to have sex. Glorious sex, the stuff dreams aspire to be, sex that both porn directors and romance novelists fail to even imagine, let alone capture in their respective mediums. If you're a woman, well, the story is going to be a bit different, get ready to start beating nerds away with a goddamn stick, a savvy game developing girl is going to be in high demand. I suggest getting a man with some muscle, someone imposing enough to keep the other men in line, but smart enough to talk code with you, and sensitive enough to know when the talking should stop, and the loving should begin. As for the rest of the story, ladies, literally volumes of them have been written, I suggest anything by Teresa Medeiros, she's pretty good as far as romance authors go. Go look her up, I'll wait.</p>
<p>Anwyays, no matter your gender, right now you're at step 1, this tutorial, so let's get started.</p>
<p>As with any great act, we must first set the stage. Like all other ambitious projects, it starts with <code>main.cpp</code> :</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="preprocessor">#include &lt;Ignatus/All.hpp&gt;</span>

<span class="keywordtype">int</span> main()
{
    Engine e(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;My Awesome Game!&quot;</span>, 640, 480);

    e.Looptastic();

    <span class="keywordflow">return</span> 0;
}
</pre></div><p>Assuming the header files are included in your compiler's search path, and that you've linked against Ignatus, sfml-system, sfml-window, sfml-graphics, and sfml-audio, this will compile and produce a beautiful blank, black window! Yay!</p>
<p>This is so simple, that an explanation almost doesn't seem worth it. But let's break it down. The two most important lines thus far, and the only ones that really *do* anything you're probably not yet aware of are these two lines:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">Engine e(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;My Awesome Game!&quot;</span>, 640, 480);
e.Looptastic();
</pre></div><p>The first line is the constructor for the Engine class, the first argument is the title for the game window, the second and third arguments are the width and height of the game window, respectively. This gives us access to all the vast resources that constitute the Engine. After this, you would do some basic initialization of your game, and then you call <code>Engine.Looptastic()</code> , which starts the game loop running.</p>
<p>If you examine the documentation, you'd find that this is the only constructor for Engine, and the only arguments it takes. "BUT WAIT!", you might be thinking, "surely there's more than just those three things that I'll need to change!" Well, it turns out that in our experience, there isn't. That's it.</p>
<p>On the off-chance that there is something else that you need to change, we provide facilities for doing so. In most cases you'll need at least a cursory understanding of SFML, infact, we recommend a good working knowledge of SFML when using this engine. It's not a requirement, but it helps, especially in cases like this where you're doing something nonstandard.</p>
<p>Let's say you needed to change the framerate, how would you do it? There are a few ways of doing it, and context usually determines which one is the best. No matter how you do it though, you need to get access to the <code>sf::App</code> that <code>Engine</code> has inside of it. The simplist and most obvious way is to do this:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">e.App-&gt;SetFramerateLimit(30);
</pre></div><p>But thoughtful observers will note that this only works in the context of <code>main()</code> , where the <code>e</code> variable exists. A more far-reaching version is this:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">_E.App-&gt;SetFramerateLimit(30);
</pre></div><p>_E is a macro that grabs the current instance of the engine, and will work basically anywhere that <em><a class="el" href="_engine_8hpp_source.html">Engine.hpp</a></em> is included.</p>
<p>As it turns out, calling methods on App happens surprisingly often, so the following form was implemented and can also be used to achieve the same result:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">_App(SetFramerateLimit(30));
</pre></div><h2>GameObjects, Text, AniObject, Sound/Music</h2>

<h2>I Need Help!</h2>
<p>Read this Tutorial, make sure you haven't missed anything, look at the documentation, and see if you can find what you're looking for in there. Then look at your code and make sure you aren't doing anything wrong. If all else fails, or if you would just talk to a person rather than code, talk to Tyler, he'll tell you how it works, or what's gone wrong.</p>
<h2>It Doesn't Do X!</h2>
<p>(X meaning any feature that you think the engine should handle)</p>
<p>Yep, it doesn't, we're sorry. Odds are though that we have a really good reason for it not doing X, it's because we haven't *needed* it. Tyler, as chief architect of the engine, feels that the engine should do everything it needs to, and nothing more. Bloat sucks, and is a general pain in the ass, exasterbated by the fact that we're using C++, so adding a myriad of whimisical features is not a Good Thing(tm).</p>
<p>If you honestly feel that feature X would make the engine significantly better, pitch it to one of the engine's developers. Better yet, implement it, give one of the developers a preview of it, and ask them to integrate it. If they like it enough, they'll put it in. If they don't put it in, don't take it personally or anything, not every feature belongs in the engine, but that doesn't mean you can't use it in your own game!</p>
<h2>This Engine Sucks!</h2>
<p>Really? I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to suck. Tell ya what, tell me (Tyler) about your problems, and I'll see what I can do to fix 'em, alright? </p>
