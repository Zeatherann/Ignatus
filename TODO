    * [DONEISH] Events (yeah, yeah, we have them, but they could be more awesome) (THEY NEED TO BE MORE AWESOME!! WE NEED A WHILE_KEY_DOWN EVENT!!!)
    ** Events are now more awesome! :D Though I wonder if I could do even better...
    ** I can do better, need KeyPressed, KeyReleased, MouseMoved, etc.
    ** Or maybe an Eventable class, so States don't have to create Triggers
    * [DONEISH] Collision Detection
    * [DONEISH] Game States
    ** We could add push_state and pop_state as well as switch_state
    * [DONEISH] Font/Text class
    * [DONEISH] Rid thee of thy warnings
    * [DONEISH] Destroy All Memory Leaks
    ** Engine.LoadImage may technically leak memory, see notes below, move LoadImage into State class instead?
    * Turn off collision detection for special GameObjects
    * [DONEISH] Documentation
    * Engine doesn't clean GameObjects up after it gets closed down
    * Depth

    DONE

    * Object Life
    * Librarify
