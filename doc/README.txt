/** \mainpage Scorched Sea/Ignatus/Ignesco/Engine

So you're making a game, and you actually have to think about how to start. How
do I load an image again? What exactly is needed for a particle effects? How do
I inform Goomba that he's just been stomped by Mario? All these things, and many
more are basically the same in every game, and your focus should be on what makes
your game unique, not what you've written 1000 times before.

This is what our engine is designed to fix. And because Tyler is being forced
to use C++, he draws inspiration from this quote:

    "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

His goal is to make game development with C++ less of a pain in the goddamn ass,
so much less that you actually forget that you're using C++ at all (until you
hit the "Compile" button, anyway). Magic is implemented everywhere possible,
magic that you will learn how to use in a few moments. For those who are worried,
consider this: The engine library itself compliles without any compiler warnings,
and there are no detectable memory leaks. It's magic, without the price.

You may have noticed that there are 4 names at the top of this page:

    - Scorched Sea
    - Ignatus
    - Ignesco
    - Engine

The first three are possible names for the game engine, which has survived thus
far nameless, as simply "The Engine". Scorched Sea and Ignatus don't mean
anything in particular, but Tyler thinks they sound cool. Ignesco also sounds
cool, with the added benefit of meaning ignite, glow, or take fire in Latin,
depending on your translation. Tyler is partial to Ignesco. Please cast your
vote or suggest a name.

As for how to harness that magic I mentioned earlier: <a href="_tutorial.html">Tutorial</a>.
