    TODO

    * Document things.
    * Engine doesn't clean GameObjects up after it gets closed down.
    * MyEnigne and MyState variables.
    * Add Ignatus::State::RemoveObject(); - In Progress
    * Add Text Input
    * Add SlideBars
    * Make ready to publicly distribute
    * Remove Particles

    THEORY

    * Move Engine::LoadImage into State class instead?
    * Differance from Music and Sound?
    * We could add push_state and pop_state as well as switch_state
    * Maybe an Eventable class, so States don't have to create Triggers
    * Check if comp has multiple cores, if so, begine to thread things
    * Allow multiple windows from states.
    * write Window Class.
    * Make Engine Local.
    * Fix FPS fluxes with particles

    DONEISH

    *  Font/Text class - Almost There
    *  Rid thee of thy warnings - Toughy
    *  Destroy All Memory Leaks - Gotta find more.
    *  Collision Detection - Needs Work.
    *  Game States - Could use Cleaning.
    *  Events - Need Mouse Events and Typing.
